## Project Specification    
Build a product page for a cosmetics shop using the [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/)  

Users should be able to filter and/or sort the page somehow (e.g. show only products by COVERGIRL, sort items by price...)    

## Project    
This was a solo project undertaken at Codeclan in Glasgow utilising a local version of the Makeup API ((https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) . It was used to gain familiarity with the React framework and work on filtering and sorting a dataset.

The application is fronted by a product container which is composed of a HeaderImageSet component and a ProductList component which themselves are made up of subcomponents (Products, FilterBy button and SortBy button).

The HeaderImageSet displays 6 random images from the displayed dataset. If the products are filtered down then the 6 random images will be from that filtered dataset. For example if the products are filtered by the brand Glossier then only Glossier products will be displayed.
